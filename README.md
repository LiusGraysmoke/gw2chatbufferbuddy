# Guild Wars 2 Chat Buffer Buddy

The purpose of this tool is to provide a lightweight means of converting large blocks of text into easily postable chunks for Guild Wars 2. This is largely useful when roleplaying where the restrictive size of the GW2 Chat Buffer is often not adequate.

## Options
- *Continue Marker:* The character that will appear at the end of every post if another is to follow it,
- *Continue Marker at Start of New Line:* Choose whether or not to include the continue marker at the start of every new line as well.
- *Post Format:*
  - Say/Party - Will not enter any additional characters at the start of a new line
  - Emote - Will Include /e at the beginning of each new line

## Features
You can manually force a new line by adding /c or a one-letter GW2 Chat Command (/e, /s, /p, etc) into the chat window. This was largely included for readability reasons when the program cuts off posts in awkward locations, like near transitions between action and speech, but also lets one format the parsing as they see fit. /c breaks the text normally. Other manual breaks will start the next block of text with the command you used.
